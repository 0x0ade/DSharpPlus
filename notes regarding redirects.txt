Every message has an "s" value (sequence). You need the store the value of the last message you've seen.

If you connect to the wrong endpoint, or in the extremely rare case that new gateways are added, you will get a redirect opcode (opcode 7) with a url parameter of the new gateway to connect to.

After connecting to the new one, you send a resume opcode (6) with the properties session_id and seq, where seq is the last s value you've seen
Then server responds with opcode 0, t RESUMED and gives you a new heartbeat interval
